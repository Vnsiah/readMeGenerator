READMEGenerator


## Description

Having a high-quality README for your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted READMe will allows you to demonstrate your skills to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile—and one that many new developers often overlook—is the README.md file. A good README will helps you stand out among other developers putting their work on GitHub.

With this in mind, Iam going to create a README generator that you no longer need to create a professional README from scratch. Simply answer a few questions and it will create a nice professional README for you.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
  * When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
    * The title of my project 
    * Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Questions
    * When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
    * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    * When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
    * When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
    * When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
    * When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
